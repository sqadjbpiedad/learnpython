title: "Why you should still learn Python (in the age of vibe coding and LLMs)"
description: "Foundational Python knowledge ensures you’re not just a user of tools—you’re a creator, capable of solving real-world problems with precision and control. While LLMs and 'vibe coding' tools may result in faster code generation, foundational knowledge of Python is still needed to debug and optimize AI-generated code."

While LLMs (especially generic ones) can produce functional Python snippets, they often lack context-specific nuances and could be full of bugs. Grasp of the language is still essential for customizing, debugging, and/or optimizing AI-generated code.

This is specially true if you are building large, complex, or production-ready solutions from scratch.

```{tip}
**MAINTAIN AUTONOMY OF YOUR CODE**

Foundational Python knowledge ensures **you are not just a user of tools**—you’re a creator, capable of solving real-world problems with precision and control.
```

## But can I still use LLMs/AI?
1. In a way, yes. Just make sure that you are making this decision consciously and that you are aware of its limitations and downsides. Don't take LLM/AI's word as gospel.
