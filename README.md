# Echoing Python Programming Language to SQAD via Brown Bag

## Introduction
In line with the continuous capability development of the Systems Quality Assurance Division, this brown bag session is designed to introduce the Python programming language as a tool to support test automation and process efficiency.

## Objectives
To enhance the Python programming competency of the Systems Quality Assurance Division by providing foundational and practical knowledge. This initiative aims to prepare team members to effectively develop and maintain automated test scripts and frameworks, supporting future automation efforts while improving testing efficiency, code quality, and overall software development lifecycle outcomes.


## Duration and schedule
08:00 AM to 5:00 PM, 23-25 February 2026
