IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) are software applications that provide comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development. These are dedicated platforms to code, compile, run, test, and debug code. They usually contain features such as linting and code completion.

In recent times, LLMs have been incorporated in IDEs.

## Why use an IDE
- **Code Completion**: Suggests functions, variables, and syntax as you type.  
- **Debugging Tools**: Step through code, inspect variables, and identify errors.  
- **Integrated Terminal/Console**: Run scripts or interact with Python directly.  
- **Project Management**: Organize files, dependencies, and virtual environments.  
- **Version Control**: Built-in support for Git (e.g., committing, pushing, pulling).  
- **Customization**: Themes, plugins, and extensions for tailored workflows.
