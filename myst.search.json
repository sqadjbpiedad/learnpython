It allows you to work on new features, fix bugs, or experiment without affecting the main code (e.g., the main or master branch).\n\nMerge - Merging is the process of combining changes from one branch into another. For example, you might merge a feature branch into the main branch to integrate new code.\n\nClone - Cloning is creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine.
